# EV-Adoption-and-Distribution-in-Washington-State

The dataset provides information on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) currently registered through the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). Several strong arguments and considerations led to concentrating on "Exploring Electric Vehicle Adoption and Distribution in Washington State" for this project. Firstly, considering that climate change and environmental sustainability have grown, a noticeable shift towards cleaner and more energy-efficient transportation options has occurred. In the fight against air pollution and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, electric vehicles, or EVs, have become an indispensable technological tool. The larger objective of encouraging environmentally friendly transportation options aligns with the EV registration trends analysis in Washington State.

Secondly, Washington State has put laws and incentives in place to promote the use of electric cars, just like many other areas have done. Understanding the effects of these policies and pinpointing areas where revisions or enhancements might be required is of great interest to legislators and government organisations.

Objectives and Queries:
The larger objective of this project is to encourage environmentally friendly transportation options, which aligns with the analysis of EV registration trends in Washington State. 
1. Understand geographic variations in electric vehicle (EV) adoption: This could involve analyzing sales figures, charging station availability, or consumer demographics across different regions.
2. Identify trends in EV sales over time: This could involve examining changes in total EV sales, specific model popularity, or market share compared to gas-powered vehicles.
3. Explore relationships between factors influencing EV adoption: This could involve investigating correlations between population density, income levels, government incentives, and EV sales figures.
Queries:
4. Which regions have the highest concentration of EV sales? (Choropleth map)
5. How have EV sales changed over the past five years, broken down by region? (Stacked bar chart)
6. Is there a correlation between population density and the number of EV registrations in a county? (Scatter plot)
7. How do consumer preferences for electric range (distance) vary across different model years? (Scatter plot)
Are there any clusters of geographic regions with similar EV adoption patterns or demographics? (Cluster analysis visualization)
